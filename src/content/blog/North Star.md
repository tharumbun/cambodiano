For the last couple of years, I have been focused on establishing a [North Star](https://marthabeck.com/product/finding-your-own-north-star/) in various areas of my life. Whether it be business, marriage, or when I coach others, I find it to be incredibly practical that others can easily latch on to. It provides a simplicity to navigating complex situations.

As a Christian, I was delighted to find supporting evidence for this idea in scripture…

> “For this prophetic message is like a piercing light shining in a gloomy place until the dawning of a new day, when the Morning Star rises in your hearts.”
> ‭‭- 2 Peter‬ ‭1‬:‭19‬ ‭TPT‬‬
