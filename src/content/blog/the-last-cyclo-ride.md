**The Last Cyclo Ride**

The sun dipped low over Phnom Penh’s skyline, casting a warm amber hue across the Tonle Sap. Dara, a cyclo driver for over 40 years, adjusted his cap and gently pedaled forward. His passenger, a young tourist, marveled at the rhythm of the city—motorbikes weaving, vendors calling out, monks gliding in saffron robes.

Dara didn’t say much. He preferred to let the streets speak for themselves.

As they passed Wat Phnom, the tourist asked, “Will cyclos still be around in ten years?”

Dara chuckled softly. “Maybe not. Maybe only in photos.”

He knew times were changing—faster than his pedals could keep up. Ride-hailing apps, tuk-tuks, and e-bikes had become the new norm. But as long as someone needed a slower ride to see the heart of the city, he’d be there.

That evening, after dropping off his passenger, Dara parked his cyclo near the riverside, watching families gather and lights flicker on. The old city had changed—but its soul? Still there, riding along.
