> # Consistency and Intentionality

2024 was a transformative year for us, shaped by our themes of *Consistency* and *Intentionality*. With a focus on building the life we truly want, we set clear goals across Relationships, Work, and Health, achieving milestones that aligned with our values and brought us closer to what matters most. Here's a look back at the year, broken down into the key areas of our Wheel of Life.

 **Relationships: Cultivating Connection**

We prioritized deepening our relationships through small but impactful habits:

- **Weekly Check-Ins:** Strengthened our communication and stayed aligned as partners.
- **Biweekly Date Nights:** Ensured time to reconnect and have fun together.
- **Family and Friends:** Monthly visits with family and seeing friends every two weeks made a difference in maintaining meaningful connections.
- **Love Letters:** Celebrating birthdays and special occasions with handwritten letters brought joy and intentionality.

One bittersweet moment was saying goodbye to Finn, our orange tabby of nearly three years. It was a tough loss. However, we were fortunate to welcome a new furry family member, Lina, our black cat lovingly nicknamed "Void."

In May, we visited my brother and sister-in-law in Franklin and got to spend time with our niece, Hannah. Later in November, we visited my sister, Liesl, and our niece, Emma, in Savannah, where we enjoyed spontaneous photoshoots...

 **Work: Growth and Alignment**

Professionally, 2024 was a year of exciting growth and intentional decision-making:

- I stepped into a **managerial role**, leading a team of three and spearheading multiple projects.
- **Figma Config 2024:** Attending this event inspired my creativity and connected me with others in the design community.

- [**Personal Portfolio**](https://lukevanzyl.com/)**:** I redesigned and launched my website (Lukevanzyl.com), showcasing my work and personal brand.

We stayed true to our values by saying "no" to projects that didn’t align with our goals or bring joy.

 Health: Strengthening Mind and Body

We made consistent health a priority this year:

- **Fitness:** We attended our local YMCA x 3 almost every single week. This is the most consistent we've ever been with working out.

- **Reading:** Completing ~~20~~ [*16* books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2024/166896422) expanded our minds and provided valuable lessons.
- **Volunteering:** Quarterly volunteer work helped us stay connected to our community and give back intentionally. I took on a few pro-bono design projects from family and friends.

 **Creativity and Personal Fulfillment**

Rediscovering my love for photography and videography was a highlight. I purchased a new camera, marking a return to a passion I had to put aside years ago when we moved.

 **Finances and New Ventures**

We closed out the year with exciting new ventures:

- **Donating Vintage Trailer**: In late 2022, Claire and I purchased a 26ft 1992 travel trailer. After years of work, we completed renovations but made the decision to donate to charity as it no longer aligned with the season we were in.

- [**Turo Side Hustle**](https://turo.com/us/en/car-rental/united-states/atlanta-ga/fiat/500/2985688)**:** We purchased a 2015 Fiat 500, named Joffrey, to launch a car-sharing side hustle. By January 2025, we had already covered all our startup fees.
- [**BlueSky Labs YouTube Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/@blueskylabsyt)**:** Revitalizing this platform to share Figma tutorials and productivity training has been an energizing new direction.

These ventures represent our broader goal of creating financial flexibility and exploring new opportunities.

 **Adventures and Memories**

- **Miami Weekend:** In February, we enjoyed a quick getaway to Miami, which was a refreshing change of pace.
