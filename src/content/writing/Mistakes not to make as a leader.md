**A lesson learned and internalized for every year of life (21)**

1. Don’t ever ask your team more than you ask of yourself
2. Be willing to let your team outshine you
3. Avoid measuring the result of something by the way it made you feel or what you got out of it personally rather than measuring its impact on everyone
4. Be a shepherd always - when a team member joins, and especially when they leave
5. Never strive, but always demonstrate excellence
6. Surround yourself with wisdom, not knowledge and mirrors
7. Thank people relentlessly, always acknowledge but don’t award
8. Check in, but don’t micro manage
9. Never miss a deadline or break a promise, follow through on consequences
10. Be the calmest person in the room, but don’t be passive
11. Outperform secretly so you can underperform publicly (and not feel insecure about people thinking you don’t serve)
12. Never forget the one, don’t become corporate-minded
13. Recognize your platform as a stone in the wall, His great platform, because it’s not yours
14. But don’t sell yourself short, He called you so step up
15. Smile a lot, but not like in a creepy way
16. Have an A—F plan, but the Holy Spirit’s spontaneity always takes priority
17. Be approachable, but solid
18. 9/10 talk to the person(s) you have an issue with immediately
19. Always show up with more than you’ll give out
20. Practice perspective: use it for scalability (view it from God’s pov) and use it for sympathy/empathy
21. Don't forget to live in the moment, it's ok to not always push for what's next

 Synthesis:

These core principles can be synthesized into overarching themes:
