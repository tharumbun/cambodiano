*10 ways to share your creativity and get discovered*

Austin Kleon

It’s not about finding an audience, they will find you… but you need to be findable.

---

1.  You don’t have to be a genius
- **::Senius::** - a collection of talented individuals that support each other by contributing and stealing ideas
   - It’s about what you contribute, not how talented or smart you are

   > Good work isn’t created in a vacuum

- Think like an amateur by experimenting unapologetically
- An amateur remembers the struggle more clearly and can more accurately guide others than an expert
- Don’t wait for things to happen

---

2.  Think process, not product
- Take people behind the scenes
   - Connect with people while you build not at the end
- Put things out there consistently to reveal more of yourself
- Become a **::documentarian::**
   - There is an art to what we all do, find a way to creatively present it to people
   - Start with the scraps from your process
   - Keep a [[Professional/Work journal]]

3.  Share something small everyday
- **::Daily dispatch::**: Review your work each day and identify one piece you can share
   - Early on —> share inspiration
   - Middle —> share methods
   - End —> show final product / what you learned
- Pick one platform with an audience you want to connect with and stick with that
- The **::so what? test::** - ask this every time you post something, don’t overshare, always try to provide value or entertainment
   - Unsure —> let it sit for 24hrs
- Pick a domain name you can own where your voice and thoughts can live… and stick with it

4.  Open up your cabinet or curiosities
- Cherish your influences
   - it reveals more about you and people can be interested in what interests you
   - [Ira Glass quote](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/113989.Ira_Glass#:~:text=All%20of%20us%20who%20do,has%20potential%2C%20but%20it's%20not.)
- Protect your curiosity, it leads to new explorations which will lead to good work
   - What you enjoy is up to you, celebrate them because it’s authentic to you and will attract authentic relationships
- Leave breadcrumb trails to your inspiration and sources
   - Attribution without a link is almost always useless
   - Don’t share things you can’t properly credit

---

5.  Tell good stories
- How you present something deeply affects how people feel about its
   - Your work doesn’t speak for itself
   - People want to know how things are made, where they came from, and who made them do
- Every “pitch” is a story with the endings chopped off
   - Act 1: the past, where you’ve been, what you want, what you did
   - Act 2: the present, where you are now
   - Act 3: the future, where you’re going and how the audience can help
- Talk about yourself at parties
   - These aren’t interrogations, use it as an opportunity to connect
   - Be able to explain your story to anyone with dignity and self respect
   - The emotion you feel when asked this will reveal your satisfaction with where you are

---

6.  Teach what you know
- Keeping what you know to yourself is bad sportsmanship, **::sharing is freeing::**
   - Learning isn’t knowing and in most cases brings you more business not less
- What in your process could help someone else? Teach them what they want to know

> “…brings you into contact with people whose opinions you should have canvased already” - Christopher Hitchen

8.  Don’t turn into human spam
