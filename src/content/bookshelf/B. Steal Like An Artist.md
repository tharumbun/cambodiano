 10 things nobody told you about being creative

1. Nothing is original
2. Don’t wait until you know who you are to get started

---

1.  **Nothing is original**
- All creative work builds on what came before. Embrace influence and remix ideas into something uniquely yours.
- “Idea Income” - average the 5 friends or sources of inspiration around you, so surround yourself with as many ideas you can draw creativity from
- It’s not the book you start with, it’s the book that book leads you to
- Collect and organize your observations

---

2.  Don’t wait until you know who you are to get started
- Start making stuff, you’re more ready than you think
- Start copying what you love

> > “Start copying what you love. Copy copy copy copy. At the end of the copy, you will find yourself.”

> > **Yoji Yamamoto**

- ::Copying is a reverse engineering process::, not about passing it off as your own work

> > “It is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique” - Conor O’Brian

---

3.  Write the book you want to read
- Do the work you want to see done

---

4.  Use your hands

> > In the digital age don’t forget to use your digits. Your hands are the original digital devices - Linda Bering

- Find a way to involve your body when you work: don’t likit your creativity to just one tool, especially early on
- Likely why whiteboarding and getting in a room to brainstorm is a healthy start

> > “Once the computer is involved things are an inevitable path to being finished” - Tom Gald

- ::Analog for thinking, digital for execution::

---

5.  Side projects and hobbies are important
- Take time to be bored, ::recharge::

> > “You can’t connect the dots looking forwards, you can only connect them looking back” - Steve Jobs

- You don’t need to cutoff a passion, keep hurting what brings you joy
- A hobby gives, doesn’t take

---

6.  Do good work and share it with people
- People aren’t generally mean, they’re just busy
- Enjoy your obscurity to explore before you have a responsibility to people that are paying you attention, or just paying you

> > “You can put yourself online to find something to say” - Austin Kleon

---

7.  Geography is no longer our master
- There’s always a community to connect with and you can make your own world until you find it
- Resetting your environment stops your brain getting too comfortable

---

8.  Be nice (the world is a small town)
- Go to where you aren’t the most talented person in the room
- Write public fan letters - you shouldn’t need them to respond
- Validation is for parking - get comfortable being misunderstood
- Keep a [[Professional/praise file]]

---

9.  Be boring (it’s the only way to get things done)
- Focus your energy on being creative, not other stuff
- Stick to your routine, inertia is the death of creativity because it takes a lot more energy to get back into the groove
- Keep your rhythm and habits
- Keep a log book (daily notes)
- Marry well - and not just your spouse

---

10.  Creativity is subtraction
- The right constraints can lead to your best work

> > “It’s often what an artist chooses to leave out that makes it interesting” - Saul Steinerg
